# Who am I?

- 👋 I’m Muuur
- 👀 I’m interested in learn python for data science and new useful skills for work or personal amusement
- 🌱 I use to code in perl, but now I'm used to python. I also learnt Javascript for web dev with HTML and CSS, bash for linux workspaces and C++ for speed.
- 💞️ I would collaborate in some projects that could interest me, but actually I don't know how to do it neither what project.
